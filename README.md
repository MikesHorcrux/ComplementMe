# ComplementMe

## Problem

This is a code test for (we'll call them) Company A

Prompt: Build an iOS application in Swift that has a button. Whenever that button is clicked, randomly pick a string from a list of strings and display it. Your list should have at least 50 items. 

## Improvments 
- add a share feat to send a compliment to a freind 
- have the app read the compliment to the use 

## Run app

clone the app and run in xcode

## Resources 

I got the compliments from hapier.com
